/// A Material Design card: a panel with slightly rounded corners and an

/// A card is a sheet of [Material] used to represent some related information,
/// for example an album, a geographical location, a meal, contact details, etc.
///
/// This is what it looks like when run:
///
/// ![A card with a slight shadow, consisting of two rows, one with an icon and
/// some text describing a musical, and the other with buttons for buying
/// tickets or listening to the show.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/card.png)

/// This sample shows creation of a [Card] widget that shows album information
/// and two actions.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/card/card.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// Sometimes the primary action area of a card is the card itself. Cards can be
/// one large touch target that shows a detail screen when tapped.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample shows creation of a [Card] widget that can be tapped. When

/// Material Design 3 introduced new types of cards. The default [Card] is the
