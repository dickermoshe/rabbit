///
/// This widget will be as big as possible if its dimensions are constrained and
/// [widthFactor] and [heightFactor] are null. If a dimension is unconstrained
/// and the corresponding size factor is null then the widget will match its
/// child's size in that dimension. If a size factor is non-null then the
/// corresponding dimension of this widget will be the product of the child's
/// dimension and the size factor. For example if widthFactor is 2.0 then
/// the width of this widget will always be twice its child's width.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// The [Align] widget in this example uses one of the defined constants from
/// [Alignment], [Alignment.topRight]. This places the [FlutterLogo] in the top
/// right corner of the parent blue [Container].

/// ```dart
/// Center(
///   child: Container(
///     height: 120.0,
///     width: 120.0,
///     color: Colors.blue[50],
///     child: const Align(
///       alignment: Alignment.topRight,

/// {@end-tool}
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// The [alignment] property describes a point in the `child`'s coordinate system
/// and a different point in the coordinate system of this widget. The [Align]
/// widget positions the `child` such that both points are lined up on top of
/// each other.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// The [Alignment] used in the following example defines two points:
///
///   * (0.2 * width of [FlutterLogo]/2 + width of [FlutterLogo]/2, 0.6 * height
///     of [FlutterLogo]/2 + height of [FlutterLogo]/2) = (36.0, 48.0) in the
///     coordinate system of the [FlutterLogo].
///   * (0.2 * width of [Align]/2 + width of [Align]/2, 0.6 * height
///     of [Align]/2 + height of [Align]/2) = (72.0, 96.0) in the
///     coordinate system of the [Align] widget (blue area).
///
/// The [Align] widget positions the [FlutterLogo] such that the two points are on
/// top of each other. In this example, the top left of the [FlutterLogo] will
/// be placed at (72.0, 96.0) - (36.0, 48.0) = (36.0, 48.0) from the top left of
/// the [Align] widget.
///
/// ![A blue square container with the Flutter logo positioned according to the
/// Alignment specified above. A point is marked at the center of the container
/// for the origin of the Alignment coordinate system.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/widgets/align_alignment.png)
///
/// ```dart
/// Center(
///   child: Container(
///     height: 120.0,
///     width: 120.0,
///     color: Colors.blue[50],
///     child: const Align(
///       alignment: Alignment(0.2, 0.6),
///       child: FlutterLogo(
///         size: 60,
///       ),
///     ),
///   ),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// The [FractionalOffset] used in the following example defines two points:
///
///   * (0.2 * width of [FlutterLogo], 0.6 * height of [FlutterLogo]) = (12.0, 36.0)
///     in the coordinate system of the [FlutterLogo].
///   * (0.2 * width of [Align], 0.6 * height of [Align]) = (24.0, 72.0) in the
///     coordinate system of the [Align] widget (blue area).
///
/// The [Align] widget positions the [FlutterLogo] such that the two points are on
/// top of each other. In this example, the top left of the [FlutterLogo] will

/// the [Align] widget.
///
/// The [FractionalOffset] class uses a coordinate system with an origin in the top-left
/// corner of the [Container] in difference to the center-oriented system used in
/// the example above with [Alignment].
