/// A Material Design "elevated button".
///
/// Use elevated buttons to add dimension to otherwise mostly flat
/// layouts, e.g. in long busy lists of content, or in wide
/// spaces. Avoid using elevated buttons on already-elevated content
/// such as dialogs or cards.
///
/// An elevated button is a label [child] displayed on a [Material]
/// widget whose [Material.elevation] increases when the button is
/// pressed. The label's [Text] and [Icon] widgets are displayed in
/// [style]'s [ButtonStyle.foregroundColor] and the button's filled
/// background is the [ButtonStyle.backgroundColor].
///
/// The elevated button's default style is defined by
/// [defaultStyleOf]. The style of this elevated button can be
/// overridden with its [style] parameter. The style of all elevated
/// buttons in a subtree can be overridden with the
/// [ElevatedButtonTheme], and the style of all of the elevated
/// buttons in an app can be overridden with the [Theme]'s
/// [ThemeData.elevatedButtonTheme] property.
///
/// The static [styleFrom] method is a convenient way to create a
/// elevated button [ButtonStyle] from simple values.
///
/// If [onPressed] and [onLongPress] callbacks are null, then the
/// button will be disabled.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample produces an enabled and a disabled ElevatedButton.
///

///  * [FilledButton], a filled button that doesn't elevate when pressed.
///  * [FilledButton.tonal], a filled button variant that uses a secondary fill color.
///  * [OutlinedButton], a button with an outlined border and no fill color.
