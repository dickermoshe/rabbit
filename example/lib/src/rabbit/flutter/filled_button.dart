/// A Material Design filled button.
///
/// Filled buttons have the most visual impact after the [FloatingActionButton],
/// and should be used for important, final actions that complete a flow,
/// like **Save**, **Join now**, or **Confirm**.
///
/// A filled button is a label [child] displayed on a [Material]
/// widget. The label's [Text] and [Icon] widgets are displayed in
/// [style]'s [ButtonStyle.foregroundColor] and the button's filled
/// background is the [ButtonStyle.backgroundColor].
///
/// The filled button's default style is defined by
/// [defaultStyleOf]. The style of this filled button can be
/// overridden with its [style] parameter. The style of all filled
/// buttons in a subtree can be overridden with the
/// [FilledButtonTheme], and the style of all of the filled
/// buttons in an app can be overridden with the [Theme]'s
/// [ThemeData.filledButtonTheme] property.
///
/// The static [styleFrom] method is a convenient way to create a
/// filled button [ButtonStyle] from simple values.
///
/// If [onPressed] and [onLongPress] callbacks are null, then the
/// button will be disabled.
///
/// To create a 'filled tonal' button, use [FilledButton.tonal].
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample produces enabled and disabled filled and filled tonal
/// buttons.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/filled_button/filled_button.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ElevatedButton], a filled button whose material elevates when pressed.
///  * [OutlinedButton], a button with an outlined border and no fill color.
///  * [TextButton], a button with no outline or fill color.

  /// Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.
  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
  /// tree.
  ///
  /// In addition, using a [GlobalKey] as the widget's [key] allows the element
  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
