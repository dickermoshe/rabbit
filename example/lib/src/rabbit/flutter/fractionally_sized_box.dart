  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
  /// tree.

  /// In addition, using a [GlobalKey] as the widget's [key] allows the element
  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.

  /// of 1.0 means that the right edge of the child is aligned with the right
  /// edge of the parent. Other values interpolate (and extrapolate) linearly.
