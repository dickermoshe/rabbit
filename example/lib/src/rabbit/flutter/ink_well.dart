/// A rectangular area of a [Material] that responds to touch.
///
/// For a variant of this widget that does not clip splashes, see [InkResponse].
///
/// The following diagram shows how an [InkWell] looks when tapped, when using
/// default values.
///
/// ![The highlight is a rectangle the size of the box.](https://flutter.github.io/assets-for-api-docs/assets/material/ink_well.png)
///
/// The [InkWell] widget must have a [Material] widget as an ancestor. The
/// [Material] widget is where the ink reactions are actually painted. This
/// matches the Material Design premise wherein the [Material] is what is
/// actually reacting to touches by spreading ink.
///
/// If a Widget uses this class directly, it should include the following line
/// at the top of its build function to call [debugCheckHasMaterial]:
///
/// ```dart
/// assert(debugCheckHasMaterial(context));
/// ```
///
/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### The ink splashes aren't visible!
///
/// If there is an opaque graphic, e.g. painted using a [Container], [Image], or
/// [DecoratedBox], between the [Material] widget and the [InkWell] widget, then
/// the splash won't be visible because it will be under the opaque graphic.
/// This is because ink splashes draw on the underlying [Material] itself, as
/// if the ink was spreading inside the material.
///
/// The [Ink] widget can be used as a replacement for [Image], [Container], or
/// [DecoratedBox] to ensure that the image or decoration also paints in the
/// [Material] itself, below the ink.
///
/// If this is not possible for some reason, e.g. because you are using an
/// opaque [CustomPaint] widget, alternatively consider using a second
/// [Material] above the opaque widget but below the [InkWell] (as an
/// ancestor to the ink well). The [MaterialType.transparency] material
/// kind can be used for this purpose.
///
/// ### InkWell isn't clipping properly
///
/// If you want to clip an InkWell or any [Ink] widgets you need to keep in mind
/// that the [Material] that the Ink will be printed on is responsible for clipping.
/// This means you can't wrap the [Ink] widget in a clipping widget directly,
/// since this will leave the [Material] not clipped (and by extension the printed
/// [Ink] widgets as well).
///
/// An easy solution is to deliberately wrap the [Ink] widgets you want to clip
/// in a [Material], and wrap that in a clipping widget instead. See [Ink] for
/// an example.
///
/// ### The ink splashes don't track the size of an animated container
/// If the size of an InkWell's [Material] ancestor changes while the InkWell's
/// splashes are expanding, you may notice that the splashes aren't clipped
/// correctly. This can't be avoided.
///
/// An example of this situation is as follows:
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// Tap the container to cause it to grow. Then, tap it again and hold before
/// the widget reaches its maximum size to observe the clipped ink splash.
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/ink_well/ink_well.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// An InkWell's splashes will not properly update to conform to changes if the
/// size of its underlying [Material], where the splashes are rendered, changes
/// during animation. You should avoid using InkWells within [Material] widgets
/// that are changing size.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [GestureDetector], for listening for gestures without ink splashes.
///  * [ElevatedButton] and [TextButton], two kinds of buttons in Material Design.
///  * [InkResponse], a variant of [InkWell] that doesn't force a rectangular
///    shape on the ink reaction.
