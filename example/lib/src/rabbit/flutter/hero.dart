/// A widget that marks its child as being a candidate for
/// [hero animations](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/animations/hero-animations).
///
/// When a [PageRoute] is pushed or popped with the [Navigator], the entire
/// screen's content is replaced. An old route disappears and a new route
/// appears. If there's a common visual feature on both routes then it can
/// be helpful for orienting the user for the feature to physically move from
/// one page to the other during the routes' transition. Such an animation
/// is called a *hero animation*. The hero widgets "fly" in the Navigator's
/// overlay during the transition and while they're in-flight they're, by
/// default, not shown in their original locations in the old and new routes.
///
/// To label a widget as such a feature, wrap it in a [Hero] widget. When
/// navigation happens, the [Hero] widgets on each route are identified
/// by the [HeroController]. For each pair of [Hero] widgets that have the
/// same tag, a hero animation is triggered.
///
/// If a [Hero] is already in flight when navigation occurs, its
/// flight animation will be redirected to its new destination. The
/// widget shown in-flight during the transition is, by default, the
/// destination route's [Hero]'s child.
///
/// For a Hero animation to trigger, the Hero has to exist on the very first
/// frame of the new page's animation.
///
/// Routes must not contain more than one [Hero] for each [tag].

/// ## Discussion
///
/// Heroes and the [Navigator]'s [Overlay] [Stack] must be axis-aligned for
/// all this to work. The top left and bottom right coordinates of each animated
/// Hero will be converted to global coordinates and then from there converted
/// to that [Stack]'s coordinate space, and the entire Hero subtree will, for
/// the duration of the animation, be lifted out of its original place, and
/// positioned on that stack. If the [Hero] isn't axis aligned, this is going to
/// fail in a rather ugly fashion. Don't rotate your heroes!
///
/// To make the animations look good, it's critical that the widget tree for the
/// hero in both locations be essentially identical. The widget of the *target*
/// is, by default, used to do the transition: when going from route A to route
/// B, route B's hero's widget is placed over route A's hero's widget. Additionally,
/// if the [Hero] subtree changes appearance based on an [InheritedWidget] (such
/// as [MediaQuery] or [Theme]), then the hero animation may have discontinuity
/// at the start or the end of the animation because route A and route B provides
/// different such [InheritedWidget]s. Consider providing a custom [flightShuttleBuilder]
/// to ensure smooth transitions. The default [flightShuttleBuilder] interpolates
/// [MediaQuery]'s paddings. If your [Hero] widget uses custom [InheritedWidget]s
/// and displays a discontinuity in the animation, try to provide custom in-flight
/// transition using [flightShuttleBuilder].
///
/// By default, both route A and route B's heroes are hidden while the
/// transitioning widget is animating in-flight above the 2 routes.
/// [placeholderBuilder] can be used to show a custom widget in their place
/// instead once the transition has taken flight.
///
/// During the transition, the transition widget is animated to route B's hero's
/// position, and then the widget is inserted into route B. When going back from
/// B to A, route A's hero's widget is, by default, placed over where route B's
/// hero's widget was, and then the animation goes the other way.
///
/// ### Nested Navigators
///
/// If either or both routes contain nested [Navigator]s, only [Hero]es
/// contained in the top-most routes (as defined by [Route.isCurrent]) *of those
/// nested [Navigator]s* are considered for animation. Just like in the
/// non-nested case the top-most routes containing these [Hero]es in the nested
/// [Navigator]s have to be [PageRoute]s.

  /// Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.
  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
  /// tree.
  ///
  /// In addition, using a [GlobalKey] as the widget's [key] allows the element
  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
  ///
  /// Generally, a widget that is the only child of another widget does not need
  /// an explicit key.

  /// to compute the hero's bounds as the flight animation's value goes from 0.0
  /// to 1.0.

  ///
  /// When both the source and destination [Hero]es provide a [flightShuttleBuilder],
  /// the destination's [flightShuttleBuilder] takes precedence.
  ///
  /// If none is provided, the destination route's Hero child is shown in-flight

  /// ## Limitations
  ///
  /// If a widget built by [flightShuttleBuilder] takes part in a [Navigator]
  /// push transition, that widget or its descendants must not have any
  /// [GlobalKey] that is used in the source Hero's descendant widgets. That is
  /// because both subtrees will be included in the widget tree during the Hero
  /// flight animation, and [GlobalKey]s must be unique across the entire widget
  /// tree.
  ///
  /// If the said [GlobalKey] is essential to your application, consider providing
  /// a custom [placeholderBuilder] for the source Hero, to avoid the [GlobalKey]
  /// collision, such as a builder that builds an empty [SizedBox], keeping the
  /// Hero [child]'s original size.
  final HeroFlightShuttleBuilder? flightShuttleBuilder;

  /// Placeholder widget left in place as the Hero's [child] once the flight takes
  /// off.

  /// By default the placeholder widget is an empty [SizedBox] keeping the Hero
  /// child's original size, unless this Hero is a source Hero of a [Navigator]
  /// push transition, in which case [child] will be a descendant of the placeholder
  /// and will be kept [Offstage] during the Hero's flight.
  final HeroPlaceholderBuilder? placeholderBuilder;

  /// Whether to perform the hero transition if the [PageRoute] transition was
  /// triggered by a user gesture, such as a back swipe on iOS.
  ///
  /// If [Hero]es with the same [tag] on both the from and the to routes have
  /// [transitionOnUserGestures] set to true, a back swipe gesture will
  /// trigger the same hero animation as a programmatically triggered push or
  /// pop.
  ///
  /// The route being popped to or the bottom route must also have
  /// [PageRoute.maintainState] set to true for a gesture triggered hero
  /// transition to work.
