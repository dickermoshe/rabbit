/// A box with a specified size.
///
/// If given a child, this widget forces it to have a specific width and/or height.
/// These values will be ignored if this widget's parent does not permit them.
/// For example, this happens if the parent is the screen (forces the child to
/// be the same size as the parent), or another [SizedBox] (forces its child to
/// have a specific width and/or height). This can be remedied by wrapping the
/// child [SizedBox] in a widget that does permit it to be any size up to the
/// size of the parent, such as [Center] or [Align].
///
/// If either the width or height is null, this widget will try to size itself to
/// match the child's size in that dimension. If the child's size depends on the
/// size of its parent, the height and width must be provided.
///
/// If not given a child, [SizedBox] will try to size itself as close to the
/// specified height and width as possible given the parent's constraints. If
/// [height] or [width] is null or unspecified, it will be treated as zero.
///
/// The [SizedBox.expand] constructor can be used to make a [SizedBox] that
/// sizes itself to fit the parent. It is equivalent to setting [width] and
/// [height] to [double.infinity].

///   height: 300.0,
///   child: Card(child: Text('Hello World!')),

  /// Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.
  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
  /// tree.
  ///
  /// In addition, using a [GlobalKey] as the widget's [key] allows the element
  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
  ///
  /// Generally, a widget that is the only child of another widget does not need
  /// an explicit key.
