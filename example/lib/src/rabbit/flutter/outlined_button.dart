/// A Material Design "Outlined Button"; essentially a [TextButton]
/// with an outlined border.
///
/// Outlined buttons are medium-emphasis buttons. They contain actions
/// that are important, but they arenâ€™t the primary action in an app.
///
/// An outlined button is a label [child] displayed on a (zero
/// elevation) [Material] widget. The label's [Text] and [Icon]
/// widgets are displayed in the [style]'s
/// [ButtonStyle.foregroundColor] and the outline's weight and color
/// are defined by [ButtonStyle.side]. The button reacts to touches
/// by filling with the [style]'s [ButtonStyle.overlayColor].
///
/// The outlined button's default style is defined by [defaultStyleOf].
/// The style of this outline button can be overridden with its [style]
/// parameter. The style of all text buttons in a subtree can be
/// overridden with the [OutlinedButtonTheme] and the style of all of the
/// outlined buttons in an app can be overridden with the [Theme]'s
/// [ThemeData.outlinedButtonTheme] property.
///
/// Unlike [TextButton] or [ElevatedButton], outline buttons have a
/// default [ButtonStyle.side] which defines the appearance of the
/// outline. Because the default `side` is non-null, it
/// unconditionally overrides the shape's [OutlinedBorder.side]. In
/// other words, to specify an outlined button's shape _and_ the
/// appearance of its outline, both the [ButtonStyle.shape] and
/// [ButtonStyle.side] properties must be specified.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// Here is an example of a basic [OutlinedButton].
///
/// ** See code in examples/api/lib/material/outlined_button/outlined_button.0.dart **
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// The static [styleFrom] method is a convenient way to create a
/// outlined button [ButtonStyle] from simple values.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [ElevatedButton], a filled button whose material elevates when pressed.
///  * [FilledButton], a filled button that doesn't elevate when pressed.
///  * [FilledButton.tonal], a filled button variant that uses a secondary fill color.
///  * [TextButton], a button with no outline or fill color.

  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the

  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
