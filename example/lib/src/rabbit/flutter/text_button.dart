/// A Material Design "Text Button".
///
/// Use text buttons on toolbars, in dialogs, or inline with other
/// content but offset from that content with padding so that the
/// button's presence is obvious. Text buttons do not have visible
/// borders and must therefore rely on their position relative to
/// other content for context. In dialogs and cards, they should be
/// grouped together in one of the bottom corners. Avoid using text
/// buttons where they would blend in with other content, for example
/// in the middle of lists.
///
/// A text button is a label [child] displayed on a (zero elevation)
/// [Material] widget. The label's [Text] and [Icon] widgets are
/// displayed in the [style]'s [ButtonStyle.foregroundColor]. The
/// button reacts to touches by filling with the [style]'s
/// [ButtonStyle.backgroundColor].
///
/// The text button's default style is defined by [defaultStyleOf].
/// The style of this text button can be overridden with its [style]
/// parameter. The style of all text buttons in a subtree can be
/// overridden with the [TextButtonTheme] and the style of all of the
/// text buttons in an app can be overridden with the [Theme]'s
/// [ThemeData.textButtonTheme] property.
///
/// The static [styleFrom] method is a convenient way to create a
/// text button [ButtonStyle] from simple values.
///
/// If the [onPressed] and [onLongPress] callbacks are null, then this
/// button will be disabled, it will not react to touch.
///

/// This sample shows various ways to configure TextButtons, from the
/// simplest default appearance to versions that don't resemble
/// Material Design at all.

  /// Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.
  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the

  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
