///
/// When passing layout constraints to its child, padding shrinks the
/// constraints by the given padding, causing the child to layout at a smaller
/// size. Padding then sizes itself to its child's size, inflated by the
/// padding, effectively creating empty space around the child.

/// ```dart
/// const Card(

///     child: Text('Hello World!'),

/// ## Design discussion
///
/// ### Why use a [Padding] widget rather than a [Container] with a [Container.padding] property?
///
/// There isn't really any difference between the two. If you supply a
/// [Container.padding] argument, [Container] builds a [Padding] widget
/// for you.
///
/// [Container] doesn't implement its properties directly. Instead, [Container]
/// combines a number of simpler widgets together into a convenient package. For
/// example, the [Container.padding] property causes the container to build a
/// [Padding] widget and the [Container.decoration] property causes the
/// container to build a [DecoratedBox] widget. If you find [Container]
/// convenient, feel free to use it. If not, feel free to build these simpler
/// widgets in whatever combination meets your needs.
///
/// In fact, the majority of widgets in Flutter are combinations of other
/// simpler widgets. Composition, rather than inheritance, is the primary
/// mechanism for building up widgets.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [EdgeInsets], the class that is used to describe the padding dimensions.
///  * [AnimatedPadding], which animates changes in [padding] over a given
///    duration.
///  * [SliverPadding], the sliver equivalent of this widget.
///  * The [catalog of layout widgets](https://flutter.dev/widgets/layout/).

  /// Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.
  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
  /// tree.
  ///
  /// In addition, using a [GlobalKey] as the widget's [key] allows the element
  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
  ///
  /// Generally, a widget that is the only child of another widget does not need
  /// an explicit key.

  ///
  ///  * The discussions at [Key] and [GlobalKey].
