/// This widget will be as big as possible if its dimensions are constrained and
/// [widthFactor] and [heightFactor] are null. If a dimension is unconstrained
/// and the corresponding size factor is null then the widget will match its
/// child's size in that dimension. If a size factor is non-null then the
/// corresponding dimension of this widget will be the product of the child's
/// dimension and the size factor. For example if widthFactor is 2.0 then
/// the width of this widget will always be twice its child's width.

///  * [Align], which lets you arbitrarily position a child within itself,
///    rather than just centering it.

  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
  /// tree.
  ///
  /// In addition, using a [GlobalKey] as the widget's [key] allows the element
  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
  ///
  /// Generally, a widget that is the only child of another widget does not need
  /// an explicit key.
