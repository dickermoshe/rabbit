/// This snippet makes the child widget (a [Card] with some [Text]) fill the
/// parent, by applying [BoxConstraints.expand] constraints:
///
/// ```dart
/// ConstrainedBox(
///   constraints: const BoxConstraints.expand(),
///   child: const Card(child: Text('Hello World!')),
/// )
/// ```
/// {@end-tool}
///
/// The same behavior can be obtained using the [SizedBox.expand] widget.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [BoxConstraints], the class that describes constraints.
///  * [UnconstrainedBox], a container that tries to let its child draw without
///    constraints.
///  * [SizedBox], which lets you specify tight constraints by explicitly
///    specifying the height or width.
///  * [FractionallySizedBox], which sizes its child based on a fraction of its
///    own size and positions the child according to an [Alignment] value.
///  * [AspectRatio], a widget that attempts to fit within the parent's
///    constraints while also sizing its child to match a given aspect ratio.

  /// Controls how one widget replaces another widget in the tree.
  ///
  /// If the [runtimeType] and [key] properties of the two widgets are
  /// [operator==], respectively, then the new widget replaces the old widget by
  /// updating the underlying element (i.e., by calling [Element.update] with the
  /// new widget). Otherwise, the old element is removed from the tree, the new
  /// widget is inflated into an element, and the new element is inserted into the
  /// tree.
  ///
  /// In addition, using a [GlobalKey] as the widget's [key] allows the element
  /// to be moved around the tree (changing parent) without losing state. When a
  /// new widget is found (its key and type do not match a previous widget in
  /// the same location), but there was a widget with that same global key
  /// elsewhere in the tree in the previous frame, then that widget's element is
  /// moved to the new location.
  ///
  /// Generally, a widget that is the only child of another widget does not need
  /// an explicit key.
