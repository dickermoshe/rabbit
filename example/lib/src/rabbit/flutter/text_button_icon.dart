/// A Material Design "Text Button".
///
/// Use text buttons on toolbars, in dialogs, or inline with other
/// content but offset from that content with padding so that the
/// button's presence is obvious. Text buttons do not have visible
/// borders and must therefore rely on their position relative to
/// other content for context. In dialogs and cards, they should be
/// grouped together in one of the bottom corners. Avoid using text
/// buttons where they would blend in with other content, for example
/// in the middle of lists.
///
/// A text button is a label [child] displayed on a (zero elevation)
/// [Material] widget. The label's [Text] and [Icon] widgets are
/// displayed in the [style]'s [ButtonStyle.foregroundColor]. The
/// button reacts to touches by filling with the [style]'s
/// [ButtonStyle.backgroundColor].
///
/// The text button's default style is defined by [defaultStyleOf].
/// The style of this text button can be overridden with its [style]
/// parameter. The style of all text buttons in a subtree can be
/// overridden with the [TextButtonTheme] and the style of all of the
/// text buttons in an app can be overridden with the [Theme]'s
/// [ThemeData.textButtonTheme] property.
///
/// The static [styleFrom] method is a convenient way to create a
/// text button [ButtonStyle] from simple values.
///
/// If the [onPressed] and [onLongPress] callbacks are null, then this
/// button will be disabled, it will not react to touch.
///
/// {@tool dartpad}
/// This sample shows various ways to configure TextButtons, from the
/// simplest default appearance to versions that don't resemble
/// Material Design at all.
